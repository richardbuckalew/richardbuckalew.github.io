### A counterfactual regret minimization solver for cribbage, plus the tools to use it
[Cribbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage) is a card game popular in Wisconsin and Minnesota. It's usually a two-player game, but it can be modified for three or four. It's a lot like [euchre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre) in one important way: it's not very complicated, so it's great for killing time or having a conversation while you play.

That *also* makes it the perfect size for a machine learning project on consumer hardware. This page documents that project, including conception & design, the code, analysis of the results, and a frontend for querying and playing against the computed solution.
